    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This is virtual lab.Its purpose is to cater to the stutends who are unable to peform experiments for any reason. Web enabled experiments can be designed for remote operation and viewing so as to enthuse the curiosity and innovation into students. This would help in learning basic and advanced concepts through remote experimentation. </p>
    <br>
     <h3>Objective</h3>
     <p>1. To provide remote-access to Labs in various disciplines of Science and Engineering. These Virtual Labs would cater to
    students at the undergraduate level, post graduate level as well as to research scholars. <br>
    2. To enthuse students to conduct experiments by the arousing their curiosity. This would help them in learning basic and
    advanced concepts through remote experimentation.
    To provide a complete Learning Management System around the Virtual Labs where the students can avail the various tools
    for learning, including additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self evaluation. <br>
    3. To share costly equipment and resources, which are otherwise available to limited number of users due to constraints on
    time and geographical distances.</p>
